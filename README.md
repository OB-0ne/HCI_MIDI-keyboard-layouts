Get all the supporting libraries. Run the following command:

Run the python communicator 
> python pythonLib/communicate_max.py

How to:
- Even though the python library is meant to serve any application, our current prototype is based on MAX/MSP
- Download Max from here: [https://cycling74.com/downloads](https://cycling74.com/downloads)
- Run the following file in Max/MSP -> MIDI Controller v0.10
- Run the following file in Max/MSP (for two handed keyboard kayout) -> 2 MIDI Controllers v0.11

# Interacting with application
- Have the python communicator running in parallel when interacting with file
> python pythonLib/communicate_max.py

- These green keys are editable
- Transpose and Octave can be changed up by pressing the key, and pressing Shift+key should get them down
- Pitch Bend and Modulation can be changed by pressing the key and moving the mouse/touchpad
